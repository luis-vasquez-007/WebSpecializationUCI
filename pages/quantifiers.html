Quantifiers are words or phrases that indicate the quantity or amount of something in a sentence. They help us to describe the extent or scope of a subject or object, and to express the degree of certainty or probability of an action or event. 

Here are some common types of quantifiers in English and their brief explanations:

1. Universal Quantifiers: These are quantifiers that refer to all members of a group or set.
Examples include "all", "every", and "each". For example, "All students must complete their assignments by Friday."
2. Existential Quantifiers: These are quantifiers that refer to at least one member of a group or set.
Examples include "some", "any", and "a few". For example, "Some of the students have already submitted their assignments."
3. Definite Quantifiers: These are quantifiers that refer to a specific number or amount of something.
Examples include "two", "three", and "several". For example, "I need to buy two new books for my class."
4. Indefinite Quantifiers: These are quantifiers that refer to a non-specific or indefinite number or amount of something. Examples include "many", "much", and "a lot of".
For example, "There are many books in the library."
5. Distributive Quantifiers: These are quantifiers that refer to each individual member of a group or set.
Examples include "each", "every", and "either". For example, "Each student should bring their own calculator to the exam."

Quantifiers play an important role in expressing the meaning and emphasis of a sentence, and understanding their usage can help you to communicate more effectively in English.                    

<center>Media example:
    "Counting Stars" by OneRepublic:
    "Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep Dreaming about the things that we could be But, baby, I've been, I've been praying hard Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars"
    In this chorus, the singer uses the quantifiers "lately" and "no more" to indicate a change in his thinking and behavior. He also uses the quantifiers "losing sleep" and "counting dollars" to describe the intensity of his desire for change, and "counting stars" as a metaphor for achieving his dreams.
