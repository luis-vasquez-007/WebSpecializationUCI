The past participle is a verb form that typically ends in -ed, -en, or -t, depending on the verb. It is used in a variety of ways in English, including as part of the present perfect tense and the passive voice. Here are some rules and explanations regarding past participles:

1. Formation of regular past participles: Most regular verbs form their past participle by adding -ed to the base form of the verb.
For example: "walk" becomes "walked", "talk" becomes "talked".
2. Formation of irregular past participles: Irregular verbs have past participles that don't follow the -ed rule. Some common irregular past participles include "broken", "spoken", "driven", "written", and "seen".
3. Use in the present perfect tense: The present perfect tense is formed with the auxiliary verb "have" followed by the past participle.
For example: "I have walked to the store." This tense is used to describe an action that happened at an unspecified time in the past and has a connection to the present.
4. Use in the passive voice: The passive voice is formed with the auxiliary verb "be" followed by the past participle.
For example: "The cake was baked by my sister." This construction is used to describe an action that was done to the subject, rather than the subject doing the action.
5. Use as an adjective: The past participle can also be used as an adjective to describe the state of the subject after an action has been performed.
For example: "The broken vase", "The spoken words".
6. Remember that some verbs have irregular past participles, and it's important to memorize those forms. Also, pay attention to context to determine whether a past participle is being used as part of the present perfect tense, passive voice, or as an adjective.

"Yesterday" by The Beatles - "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away / Now it looks as though they're here to stay / Oh, I believe in yesterday."
