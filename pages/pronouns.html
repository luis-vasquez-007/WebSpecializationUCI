Pronouns are words that replace nouns to avoid repetition in a sentence. They can be used in place of a noun or a noun phrase, and they typically refer to people, things, or ideas.

There are several different types of pronouns, each with their own rules and explanations:

1. Personal pronouns: These pronouns are used to refer to specific people or things. They include:
• Subject pronouns (I, you, he, she, it, we, they): Used as the subject of a sentence.
• Object pronouns (me, you, him, her, it, us, them): Used as the object of a verb or preposition.

2. Possessive pronouns: These pronouns show ownership or possession. They include:
• My, mine
• Your, yours
• His, her, hers
• Its
• Our, ours
• Their, theirs

3. Reflexive pronouns: These pronouns refer back to the subject of the sentence. They include:
• Myself
• Yourself
• Himself, herself, itself
• Ourselves
• Themselves

4. Demonstrative pronouns: These pronouns point to specific people or things. They include:
• This, these
• That, those

5. Interrogative pronouns: These pronouns are used to ask questions. They include:
• Who
• Whom
• Whose
• What
• Which

6. Indefinite pronouns: These pronouns refer to people or things in a general or unspecified way. They include:
• Anyone, anybody, anything
• Everyone, everybody, everything
• Someone, somebody, something
• No one, nobody, nothing
• All, both, each, either, neither, some, any, few, many, several

Understanding and using pronouns correctly is an important part of effective communication in English. It can help make your writing more concise and avoid confusion or ambiguity.

<center>Media example:
    One famous song that mentions almost all the pronouns in English is "Somebody That I Used to Know" by Gotye featuring Kimbra: "Now and then I think of when we were together / Like when you said you felt so happy you could die / Told myself that you were right for me / But felt so lonely in your company / But that was love and it's an ache I still remember"
    "You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness / Like resignation to the end, always the end / So when we found that we could not make sense / Well you said that we would still be friends / But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over"
    "Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over / But had me believing it was always something that I'd done / But I don't wanna live that way / Reading into every word you say / You said that you could let it go / And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know"
