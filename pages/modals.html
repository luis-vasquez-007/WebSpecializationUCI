    Modals are a type of auxiliary verb that are used to express various shades of meaning in a sentence.

    Here are some brief rules and explanations for modals:

    1. Modal verbs are always followed by the base form of the verb.
    2. Modals do not change their form, regardless of the tense or subject of the sentence.
    3. Modals are used to express various meanings such as possibility, necessity, ability, permission, suggestion, request, etc.
    4. Some common modal verbs are can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, and would.
    5. "Can" is used to express ability or possibility.
    For example, "I can swim."
    6. "Could" is used to express past ability or possibility.
    For example, "I could swim when I was younger."
    7. "May" is used to express possibility or permission.
    For example, "I may go to the party tonight."
    8. "Might" is used to express possibility, especially when there is some uncertainty.
    For example, "It might rain tomorrow."
    9. "Must" is used to express necessity or obligation.
    For example, "I must finish my homework before I go out."
    10. "Shall" is used to make suggestions or give commands.
    For example, "Shall we go to the movies?"
    11. "Should" is used to give advice or make suggestions.
    For example, "You should eat more vegetables."
    12. "Will" is used to express future certainty or willingness.
    For example, "I will be there at 7 pm."
    13. "Would" is used to express past habits or polite requests.
    For example, "When I was younger, I would always play soccer after school."

    Overall, modals are very useful for adding nuance to sentences and expressing different shades of meaning.
