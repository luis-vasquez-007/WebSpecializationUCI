Gerunds and infinitives are both types of verb forms that function as nouns in a sentence. Gerunds end in "-ing" and infinitives are usually introduced with the word "to".

Here are some brief explanations and rules for using gerunds and infinitives:

Gerunds:

• Gerunds are used as the subject or object of a sentence.
Example: Swimming is good exercise. (Gerund "swimming" is the subject of the sentence)
• Gerunds can also be used after certain verbs as their direct object.
Example: I enjoy singing. (Gerund "singing" is the direct object of the verb "enjoy")
• Gerunds can be used after prepositions.
Example: She is good at dancing. (Gerund "dancing" is the object of the preposition "at")

Infinitives:

• Infinitives can be used as the subject or object of a sentence.
Example: To study is important. (Infinitive "to study" is the subject of the sentence)
• Infinitives can also be used after certain verbs as their direct object.
Example: She wants to eat pizza. (Infinitive "to eat" is the direct object of the verb "wants")
• Infinitives can be used after certain adjectives.
Example: It's difficult to understand. (Infinitive "to understand" is used after the adjective "difficult")

Note: There are certain verbs that can be followed by either a gerund or an infinitive with a change in meaning. For example, "remember to do" means to not forget to do something, while "remember doing" means to have a memory of doing something.

    Song: "Don't Stop Believin'" by Journey
    Lyrics: Just a small-town girl Livin' in a lonely world She took the midnight train goin' anywhere Just a city boy Born and raised in South Detroit He took the midnight train goin' anywhere
    [Chorus] Don't stop believin' Hold on to that feelin' Streetlights, people Don't stop believin' Hold on Streetlights, people
    The song uses the gerund "livin'" to describe the girl's current state and the infinitive "to go" to describe the action of taking the train. Similarly, it uses the gerund "born and raised" to describe the boy's past and the infinitive "to go" to describe the action of taking the train. The chorus uses the gerund "believin'" and the infinitive "to hold on" to express a message of encouragement and perseverance.
