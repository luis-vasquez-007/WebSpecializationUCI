Present perfect and present perfect progressive are both tenses used to talk about actions or events that started in the past and continue up until now, but they have slightly different uses and implications.

Present Perfect:

• The present perfect tense is used to describe actions or events that happened at an unspecified time in the past, with a focus on their current relevance or connection to the present.
• It's formed with the auxiliary verb "have" or "has" + the past participle of the main verb (e.g., "I have eaten", "She has traveled").

Present Perfect Progressive:

• The present perfect progressive (also called present perfect continuous) is used to describe actions or events that started in the past and are still ongoing, with a focus on the duration or progress of the action.
• It's formed with the auxiliary verb "have" or "has" + been + the present participle (-ing form) of the main verb (e.g., "I have been eating", "She has been traveling").

Here are some examples to illustrate the difference:

Present Perfect:

• I have seen that movie before. (implies that the speaker has seen the movie at some point in the past, but doesn't specify when).
• She has studied French for five years. (implies that the action started in the past and is still relevant to the present).

Present Perfect Progressive:

• I have been watching TV for two hours. (implies that the action started in the past and is still ongoing).
• She has been working on that project all week. (implies that the action started in the past and is still in progress).
