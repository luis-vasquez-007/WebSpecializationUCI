Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns or pronouns by giving more information about their qualities or characteristics.

Here are some rules and explanations regarding adjectives:

1. Placement: Adjectives usually come before the noun they modify.
For example, "red apple" or "happy dog". However, in some cases, they can come after the noun, such as in the phrase "the president elect".
2. Degrees of comparison: Adjectives have three degrees of comparison: positive, comparative, and superlative. The positive degree is the basic form of the adjective, such as "tall". The comparative degree is used when comparing two things, such as "taller". The superlative degree is used when comparing three or more things, such as "tallest".
3. Agreement: Adjectives must agree in number and gender with the noun they modify.
For example, "the green apples" or "the happy dogs".
4. Order: When multiple adjectives are used to describe a noun, there is a specific order that should be followed. The order is generally: opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, and purpose.
For example, "a beautiful large antique wooden table".
5. Predicate adjectives: Adjectives can also be used as predicate adjectives, which come after a linking verb and describe the subject of the sentence.
For example, "The soup is hot" or "She seems happy".
6. Limiting adjectives: Some adjectives are used to limit or specify a noun, such as "this", "that", "each", or "every".
For example, "this book" or "every student".

Overall, adjectives are an essential part of language that help us to provide more detailed and descriptive information about the world around us.          

<center>Media example:
    "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen: 
    Is this the real life?
    Is this just fantasy?
    Caught in a landslide,
    No escape from reality
    Open your eyes,
    Look up to the skies and see,
    I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
    Because I'm easy come, easy go,
    Little high, little low,
    Any way the wind blows it doesn't really matter to
    Me, to me...
