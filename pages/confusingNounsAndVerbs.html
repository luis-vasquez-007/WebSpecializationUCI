Nouns are words that refer to people, places, things, or ideas, while verbs are words that express action, occurrence, or state of being. Confusing nouns and verbs can be a common mistake, especially for non-native English speakers.

Here are some brief explanations and rules to help differentiate nouns and verbs:

1. Word Form: Nouns are usually identified by their form as they often end with -tion, -ment, -ness, -ity, -ance, -ence, -ness, -hood, or -ship, while verbs often end with -ing, -ed, or -en.
2. Usage: Nouns typically serve as the subject or object in a sentence, or as a descriptor, while verbs express the action or occurrence of the subject.
3. Derivation: Many verbs can be derived from nouns by adding suffixes such as -ify, -ize, or -ate, while some nouns can be derived from verbs by adding suffixes like -ment, -tion, or -ance.
4. Context: Understanding the context in which a word is used can often help distinguish between a noun and a verb.
For example, "read" can be a verb meaning to look at and comprehend written or printed material, or a noun referring to a particular interpretation or version of something.

Some examples:

Compliment means to give praise, express admiration or giving congratulations. Complement, on the other hand, means completing something or to make something perfect:

1. The colors in the pillows complemented the stripes in the sofa very well.
2. She paid her boss a nice compliment on how well her new hairdo complemented her complexion.

Advice is the noun and advise is the verb. They both mean "suggestion about what someone should do":

1. Let me give you some advice: stay away from Margaret.
2. I have two pieces of advice for you about the holiday.
3. I strongly advise you to lose weight.
4. They finally did what we advised.

Advice is uncountable. If we want to use advice in a countable way, then we use the phrase a piece of advice.

Choice is a noun that refers to the act of picking something or the options available to be picked. Choose is a verb, the actual action of picking or deciding on something:

1. I choose Ken as my lab partner.
2. Pat has to make a choice between the red dress and the yellow dress.
3. The red dress was a good choice.

Success is a noun and means "good outcome". Succeed is a verb and means "to attain success":

1. I wish you great success in your work.
2. I didn't have much success in finding a job.
3. I have succeeded in my business.
4. I'm going to succeed this year.
5. She wants to succeed in her job.

Breathe is a verb we use for the process of inhaling and exhaling. Breath is a noun that refers to a full cycle of breathing. It can also refer to the air that is inhaled or exhaled:

1. I realized as I watched him fight for breath, that his life was as important to him as mine is to me.
2. Press your shoulder blades down and keep your head and neck relaxed. Hold this for 5-10 breaths.
3. Many people find observing their breath flowing in and out is a good way to stay mindful.
4. Children with sickle cell disease may breathe easier when they’re given hydroxyurea...
5. Allowing a wine to ‘breathe’ is simply a process of exposing it to air for a period of time before serving.
6. Designers sweat the details to let athletic clothes breathe.

Overall, learning the proper usage and form of nouns and verbs takes time and practice, but keeping these rules and explanations in mind can help improve your language skills.
