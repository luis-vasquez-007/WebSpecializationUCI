The present perfect progressive tense is formed by using "have/has been" + the present participle of a verb (ending in -ing). It is used to describe an action that started in the past, has continued up until the present moment, and is likely to continue into the future.

Here are some key rules and explanations:

1. Formation: Subject + has/have + been + verb + ing.
Example: "I have been studying all day."
2. Use: It is used to describe an action that started in the past and has continued up until now. It emphasizes the duration of the action and that it is still ongoing.
Example: "I have been working on this project for three months."
3. Emphasis on duration: The present perfect progressive emphasizes the duration of the action rather than the completion of the action.
Example: "He has been living in New York for five years." (He still lives in New York.)
4. Temporary actions: The present perfect progressive can also be used to describe a temporary action that started in the past and continues up until the present moment.
Example: "She has been staying with us for a few days."
5. Negative form: The negative form is "has/have not been" + verb + ing.
Example: "I have not been feeling well lately."
6. Question form: The question form is "has/have + subject + been + verb + ing?".
Example: "Have you been working out lately?"

Overall, the present perfect progressive is used to describe an ongoing action or state that started in the past and is still happening at the moment of speaking. It emphasizes the duration of the action and its continuity.

    "I've been waiting for a girl like you" by Foreigner: "So long, I've been looking too hard, I've been waiting too long; sometimes I don't know what I will find, I only know it's a matter of time."
