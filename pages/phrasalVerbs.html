Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb and one or more particles (such as adverbs or prepositions) that together create a new meaning.

Here are some rules and explanations for phrasal verbs:

1. Separable vs inseparable phrasal verbs: Some phrasal verbs can be separated, meaning that the object can go between the verb and the particle, while others are inseparable, meaning that the object must come after the particle.
For example, "turn off" is a separable phrasal verb ("turn the lights off"), while "give up" is inseparable ("I gave up smoking").
2. Literal vs idiomatic meanings: Phrasal verbs can have a literal meaning, which is a straightforward combination of the verb and particle, or an idiomatic meaning, which is a figurative or non-literal meaning.
For example, "take off" can mean literally removing something ("take off your hat"), or idiomatically leaving or departing ("the plane took off").
3. Contextual meaning: The meaning of a phrasal verb can also depend on the context in which it is used.
For example, "break down" can mean to stop working properly ("my car broke down"), to become overwhelmed emotionally ("I broke down in tears"), or to analyze or categorize something ("let's break down the problem into smaller parts").
4. Phrasal verbs with multiple meanings: Many phrasal verbs have multiple meanings, both literal and idiomatic.
For example, "get up" can mean to physically rise from a seated or lying position ("get up from the couch"), or to wake up and start the day ("I usually get up at 6am").

Remember, phrasal verbs can be tricky because they often don't follow predictable patterns, and their meanings can be difficult to guess from their individual parts. The best way to learn phrasal verbs is to study them in context and practice using them in your own writing and speaking.
                    
<center>Media example:
    "Far Away" by Nickelback does contain some phrasal verbs. Here are a few examples:
    1. "I love you; I have loved you all along"
    * "Loved along" is a phrasal verb that means to love someone continuously or for a long time.
    2. "Cause with you, I'd withstand all of hell to hold your hand"
    * "withstand" is a phrasal verb that means to endure or resist something.
    3. "And I miss you, been far away for far too long"
    * "miss" and "been far away" are both phrasal verbs. "Miss" means to feel the absence of someone or something, while "been far away" means to have been away from a place or person for a long time
