In English, articles are words used to indicate whether a noun refers to a specific or general entity. There are two types of articles: definite articles and indefinite articles.

Indefinite articles (a, an) are used before singular nouns that are non-specific or unidentified. The choice between a or an depends on the initial sound of the next word: use "a" before words that start with consonants and "an" before words that start with vowels or vowel sounds.

Examples:
• I need a book to read.
• An apple a day keeps the doctor away.

Definite article "the" is used before a noun that refers to a specific entity or when the noun is already known or has been previously mentioned in the context. The definite article can also be used before a noun when it is the only one of its kind or when it is a general reference to a group.

Examples:
• I'm going to the store. (a specific store)
• The sun is shining. (there's only one sun)
• The cats in my neighborhood are very friendly. (a general reference to all the cats in the neighborhood)

It's important to note that there are certain situations where no article is needed, such as when referring to plural or uncountable nouns in general or when referring to abstract concepts.
                
<center>Media example:
    "Hey Jude" by The Beatles, the lyrics include both definite and indefinite articles. For example, in the opening verse:
    "Hey Jude, don't make it bad Take a sad song and make it better Remember to let her into your skin Then you begin to make it better"
    In this verse, "a sad song" is an example of an indefinite article, because it is referring to any sad song, not a specific one. On the other hand, "the skin" is an example of a definite article, because it is referring to a specific part of the body.
