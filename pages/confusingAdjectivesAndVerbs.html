Adjectives and adverbs are both parts of speech that modify or describe other words in a sentence. However, they differ in how they modify the words they describe.

Adjectives modify nouns or pronouns and provide information about their size, color, shape, and other qualities. They are usually placed before the noun they modify, but can also come after a linking verb such as "to be" or "to seem."
For example, in the sentence "the big house," "big" is an adjective modifying the noun "house."

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs and provide information about the manner, time, frequency, or degree of the action or description. They are usually placed after the verb or adjective they modify, but can also be placed at the beginning or end of a sentence.
For example, in the sentence "he ran quickly," "quickly" is an adverb modifying the verb "ran."

Some confusing adjectives and adverbs rules include:

1. Adjectives ending in -ly: Some adjectives end in -ly, such as "friendly" or "lonely," but these are not adverbs. Instead, they are still adjectives and should not be used to modify verbs.
For example, saying "he walked lonely" is incorrect, and should be "he walked alone."
2. Comparative and superlative forms: Adjectives and adverbs have comparative and superlative forms to indicate degrees of comparison. Comparative forms are used to compare two things, while superlative forms are used to compare three or more things.
For example, the comparative form of "fast" is "faster" and the superlative form is "fastest." It's important to use the correct form when comparing different things.
3. Double negatives: Double negatives occur when two negative words are used in the same sentence, such as "I don't have nothing." This is grammatically incorrect and can cause confusion. Instead, use a single negative word to convey the intended meaning.
4. Irregular adverbs: Some adverbs have irregular forms and do not follow the typical -ly ending, such as "well" and "fast." It's important to memorize these irregular forms to use them correctly in sentences.

Remembering these rules can help you use adjectives and adverbs correctly and avoid confusion in your writing and speaking.
