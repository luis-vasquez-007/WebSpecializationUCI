Countable nouns are nouns that can be counted and have a plural form. They refer to things that can be quantified as individual units.
For example, "dog" is a countable noun, and its plural form is "dogs". You can count how many dogs you see, and you can say "one dog" or "two dogs".

Uncountable nouns, on the other hand, are nouns that cannot be counted as individual units and do not have a plural form. They refer to things that are not easily quantifiable.
For example, "water" is an uncountable noun. You can't count how many waters you have, and you can't say "two waters". Instead, you would use a different unit of measurement, such as "two glasses of water".

Here are some key rules and explanations about countable and uncountable nouns:

• Countable nouns can be singular or plural, while uncountable nouns are always singular.
• Countable nouns can be used with numbers and quantifiers such as "a", "an", "two", "few", "many", while uncountable nouns are usually used with words like "some", "a little", "a lot of", "much".
• Countable nouns can be used with articles "a/an" and "the", while uncountable nouns are usually used with "the" or no article at all.
• Countable nouns can be modified by both plural and singular adjectives, while uncountable nouns are usually modified by singular adjectives.
• Some nouns can be both countable and uncountable, depending on their meaning.
For example, "paper" can refer to a sheet of paper (countable) or to the substance made from wood pulp (uncountable).
• There are some specific uncountable nouns that have their own rules, such as "advice", "furniture", and "information". These nouns are always singular and take singular verbs, but can be used with "some" or "a lot of" to indicate quantity.

Examples:
1. There are many people living in the many houses on that street
2. Because there was so little fire, people noticed little smoke.
3. He put lots of chocolate chips and lots of sugar into the cookie dough.
4. If you put a little bit more effort into this, I’m sure you can have a little bit more success.
5. They put plenty of thought into their plans, and were able to think of plenty of ideas.
                    
<center>Media example:
    "Someone Like You" by Adele
    Lyrics:
    Countable use: "Nevermind, I'll find someone like you"
    In this line, "someone" is a countable noun, as it refers to a specific person that Adele is looking for.
    Uncountable use: "I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it"
    In these lines, "hate," "turn up," "blue," "uninvited," "stay," and "fight" are all uncountable nouns or verbs. They cannot be counted as discrete units, but instead describe concepts or actions.
