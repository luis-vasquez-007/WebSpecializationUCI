In the English language, there are certain rules and structures that are commonly used when making requests or asking for permission. 

Here are some explanations of these rules:

1.Making requests: When making a request, it is polite to use a modal verb such as "could", "would", or "can".
For example: "Could you please pass the salt?" or "Would you mind closing the window?" In addition, it is common to use the word "please" to show politeness and gratitude. It is also important to use an appropriate tone of voice and body language when making a request.
2.Giving permission: When giving permission, it is common to use the modal verb "may".
For example: "You may leave the room now." It is also common to use the phrase "you're welcome" to show that the request has been granted. In some cases, it may be necessary to give specific conditions or restrictions when granting permission.
3.Asking for permission: When asking for permission, it is also common to use the modal verb "may". 
For example: "May I leave the room?" It is important to use a polite tone of voice and body language when asking for permission. In some cases, it may be necessary to give a reason for the request.

More examples:

1. May I borrow your pen, please?
2. Could I speak to Tom Lee, please?
3. Could you help me with this report?
4. Can I borrow your pen, please?
5. Can you tell me where the bank is, please?
6. Will you please be quiet?
7. Would you please ask her to call me?

Overall, when making requests or asking for permission in English, it is important to use polite language, appropriate tone of voice and body language, and to show gratitude when a request is granted.                 

<center>Media example:
    
"Hey you" by Pink Floyd: "Hey you, out there in the cold Getting lonely, getting old Can you feel me?"
In this case, the modal verb "can" be used to ask for permission to connect with the person in the cold who is feeling lonely and old.
Another example is in the second verse of the song, where the singer says:
"But it was only a fantasy The wall was too high, as you can see No matter how he tried, he could not break free and the worms ate into his brain"
In this case, the modal verb "could" be used to express a request or permission that the person in the fantasy could not break free from the wall, despite his efforts.
Overall, "Hey You" by Pink Floyd uses modal verbs such as "can" and "could" to convey requests and permissions in different parts of the song.
